Hybrid AI Chatbot: A simple, interactive chatbot built with Node.js, combining the power of Brain.js for fast local responses and OpenAI's GPT API for intelligent, natural conversations. The bot uses local machine learning to answer known patterns and smartly switches to GPT when deeper understanding is needed.
